# Project Properties Guidelines and Recommendations

A comprehensive guide for inputting useful and correct properties for projects in the Portfolio Management System.

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for entering project properties that ensure data quality, consistency, and analytical value across the portfolio management system. The system supports two main data models:

1. **Standard Portfolio Model** (`toy-data/`) - Traditional project management approach
2. **Advanced Evaluation Model** (`dl-example/`) - Research-focused with qualitative evaluation translation

## Core Project Properties

### Essential Identifiers

#### `project_id`
- **Format**: Use consistent naming convention (e.g., `PRJ001`, `LOGOS_CORE_001`)
- **Requirements**: 
  - Unique across entire portfolio
  - No spaces or special characters except underscore/hyphen
  - Maximum 20 characters
- **Examples**: 
  - ✅ `PRJ001`, `NIMBUS_ETH2_001`, `STATUS_APP_001`
  - ❌ `Project 1`, `PRJ-001 (New)`, `Very Long Project Name ID`

#### `name`
- **Format**: Clear, descriptive project name
- **Requirements**:
  - 5-80 characters
  - Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood
  - Use title case
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ `Customer Portal Redesign`, `Nimbus Ethereum 2.0 Client`
  - ❌ `CPR`, `proj1`, `THE REALLY LONG PROJECT NAME THAT GOES ON FOREVER`

#### `description`
- **Format**: Concise but comprehensive project summary
- **Requirements**:
  - 20-500 characters
  - Include key objectives and deliverables
  - Avoid technical jargon for stakeholder clarity
- **Template**: `[Action] [Target] to [Outcome] by [Method]`
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ `Modernize customer-facing web portal to improve user experience and reduce support tickets`
  - ❌ `Portal stuff`, `Update the thing`

### Status and Timeline Properties

#### `status`
- **Valid Values**: `Planning`, `Active`, `On Hold`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`
- **Guidelines**:
  - Update regularly (at least weekly for active projects)
  - Use `On Hold` for temporary suspensions, `Cancelled` for permanent termination
  - `Planning` for approved but not yet started projects

#### `start_date` / `end_date`
- **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601)
- **Requirements**:
  - Start date must be <= end date
  - Use realistic estimates based on similar projects
  - Include buffer time for dependencies and risks
- **Guidelines**:
  - For planning phase: Use target dates with 20-30% buffer
  - For active projects: Update based on current progress
  - Consider dependencies when setting dates

#### `completion_percentage`
- **Range**: 0-100 (integer)
- **Guidelines**:
  - Base on deliverables completed, not time elapsed
  - Update at least bi-weekly
  - Use milestone-based calculation for accuracy
- **Calculation**: `(Completed Milestones / Total Milestones) × 100`

### Financial Properties

#### `budget_allocated` / `budget_spent`
- **Format**: Numeric values in base currency (no commas)
- **Requirements**:
  - `budget_spent` <= `budget_allocated`
  - Include all project costs (labor, materials, overhead)
  - Update `budget_spent` monthly minimum
- **Guidelines**:
  - Include 10-15% contingency in allocated budget
  - Track actual vs. planned spending trends
  - Consider currency fluctuations for multi-region projects

#### `construction_cost` (Research Model)
- **Range**: 0.1 - 10.0 (normalized scale)
- **Guidelines**:
  - Relative to portfolio average (1.0 = average cost)
  - Include total cost of ownership
  - Consider opportunity costs

### Priority and Risk Properties

#### `strategic_priority`
- **Valid Values**: `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`
- **Guidelines**:
  - Limit `Critical` to <20% of portfolio
  - Align with organizational strategic objectives
  - Review quarterly and adjust based on business changes

#### `risk_level`
- **Valid Values**: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical`
- **Assessment Criteria**:

- **Format**: Decimal ratio (e.g., 1.5 = 150% return)
- **Calculation**: `(Benefits - Costs) / Costs`
- **Guidelines**:

3. **Naming**: Follow established naming conventions
4. **Updates**: Maintain regular update schedules
5. **Validation**: Implement data validation rules

### Completeness Standards

#### Required Fields (Cannot be null/empty)
- `project_id`, `name`, `description`
- `status`, `start_date`, `strategic_priority`
- `budget_allocated`, `risk_level`

#### Recommended Fields (Should be populated)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Data Entry Errors

❌ **Inconsistent Date Formats**
```
start_date: "Jan 15, 2025"  # Wrong
start_date: "15/01/2025"    # Wrong
start_date: "2025-01-15"    # Correct
```

❌ **Unrealistic Completion Percentages**
```
# Project started yesterday, 50% complete - unrealistic
# Base on actual deliverables completed
```

❌ **Vague Descriptions**
```
description: "Update system"           # Too vague
description: "Fix bugs"                # Not descriptive
description: "Modernize customer portal to improve user experience and reduce support tickets"  # Good
```

### Strategic Assessment Errors

❌ **Grade Inflation**
```
# Not every project can be "Critical" priority
# Use normal distribution across priority levels
```

❌ **Inconsistent Scoring**
```
# Ensure scoring criteria are applied consistently
# Document scoring rationale for major projects
```

❌ **Ignoring Dependencies**
```
# Always consider project interdependencies
# Update dependency lists when project scope changes
```

### Financial Tracking Issues

❌ **Incomplete Cost Tracking**
```
# Include all costs: labor, materials, overhead, opportunity costs
# Don't forget indirect costs and shared resources
```

❌ **Unrealistic Budgets**
```
# Include contingency buffers (10-15%)
# Base estimates on historical data from similar projects
```

## Data Validation Rules

### Automated Checks
```sql
-- Date consistency
CHECK (start_date <= end_date)
CHECK (end_date >= CURRENT_DATE OR status IN ('Completed', 'Cancelled'))

-- Budget consistency  
CHECK (budget_spent <= budget_allocated)
CHECK (budget_allocated > 0)

-- Percentage ranges
CHECK (completion_percentage >= 0 AND completion_percentage <= 100)

-- Score ranges (for strategic dimensions)
CHECK (innovation_score >= 1 AND innovation_score <= 10)
CHECK (strategic_value >= 0.0 AND strategic_value <= 1.0)
```

### Business Rules
- Maximum 20% of projects can have "Critical" priority
- Projects in "Planning" status must have completion_percentage = 0
- Projects in "Completed" status must have completion_percentage = 100
- Active projects must have recent updates (within 14 days)
